# README

## Overview
This repository contains the data and code associated with our paper: Accurate prediction of thermoresponsive phase behavior of disordered proteins. The repository is organized into two main folders:

- **Data**: Contains the data used to generate each figure in the paper.
- **Code**: Contains the code necessary for simulations and analysis.
- **Model Parameter Tables**: Contains the full parameter tables for well-depth energies for Models 1, 2, 3.

## Code Folder Contents
The **Code** folder includes the following:

1. **Revised Wang-Frenkel Potential Implementation**: The updated implementation used in our simulations. This implementation must be compiled in LAMMPS in order to run the simulations below.
2. **Single Protein Chain Simulations**: Example input files for simulating single protein chains using Models 1, 2, and 3.
3. **Multiple Protein Chain Simulations**: Example input files for simulating multiple protein chains using Models 1, 2, and 3.

## Usage
To reproduce the simulations, use the provided input files along with the revised Wang-Frenkel potential implementation. Detailed instructions on running the simulations can be found in the corresponding script files.
